# Django's workflow: MVC, where views are more like controllers, and templates are
# actually the views. When a HTTP request comes in, Django uses rules to figure out
# which view function to call (this is called "resolving the url". The view function
# then processes the url and returns a http response.

# Here, we create a test to resolve the root of the site ("/") and return a HTTP 
# response.
